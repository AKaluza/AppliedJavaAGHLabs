### Infinite Streams
Infinite streams are sequential unordered streams with an unending sequence of elements.
1. generate() -  returns an infinite sequential unordered stream where each element is generated by the provided Supplier.
   This is suitable for generating constant streams, streams of random elements, etc
2. iterate() - s a common way of generating an infinite sequential stream. The iterate() method takes two parameters: an initial value called the seed element,
   and a function that generates the next element using the previous value.
   This continues until we generate the number of elements specified by the limit() operation which acts as the terminating condition.
   These types of operations which terminate an infinite stream are called short-circuiting operations.
   Other short-circuiting operations: findFirst() and findAny()
   The iterate() method is stateful by design so it is not useful in parallel streams
