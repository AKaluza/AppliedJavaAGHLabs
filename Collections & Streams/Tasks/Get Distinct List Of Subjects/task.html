<h1>Applied Java: Streams</h1>

<h2>Exercise: Get Distinct List OF Subject</h2>

<p>You have got a list of Students.
    You want to know in which Subjects students from your list participate in.</p>

<p>getDistinctListOfSubjects method currently returns an empty LinkedList.
    Use Streams to return the proper list of Subject without duplicates.</p>

<div class="hint">
    Need to use flatMap, which maps elements of the first stream (of students) to a stream of subjects (in this example).
    Uses distinct and then collects into a list
</div>
