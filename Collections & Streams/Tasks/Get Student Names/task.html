<h1>Applied Java: Streams</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We deal with an app for a dean's office at a university. So we have Students
    (which have a name, a specified age, they come from a particular City).
    We also know in which Subjects (courses) they participate and their overall grade.</p>

<p>You are an employee at a dean's office.</p>

<h2>Exercise: Get Student Names</h2>

<p>You have got a list of Students.
    You want to get list of all names of the Student on that list</p>

<p>getStudentNames method currently returns an empty LinkedList.
    Use Streams to return the proper list of names.</p>
