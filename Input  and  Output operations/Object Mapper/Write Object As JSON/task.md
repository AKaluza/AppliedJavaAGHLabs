### Write JSON From Objects
The Jackson ObjectMapper can also be used to generate JSON from an object. You do so using the one of the methods:

1. `writeValue()`
2. `writeValueAsString()`
3. `writeValueAsBytes()`

Your task is to fix `writeAsJSON` so that 
the properly generated JSON string is shipped to output stream
