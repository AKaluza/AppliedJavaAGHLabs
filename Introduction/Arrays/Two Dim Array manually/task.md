### **Goal**

Write a Java program that:

* Creates a **jagged 2D integer array** where each row has a different length (`1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` elements).
* Fills the array with **consecutive integers** using nested `for` loops.
* Prints the array so each row displays its elements on a separate line.

This task introduces:

* jagged (non-rectangular) multidimensional arrays,
* nested loops with varying inner lengths,
* row/column indexing,
* sequential assignment in uneven matrices.
