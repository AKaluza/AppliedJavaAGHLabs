### Mockito - Expecting Calls
Mockito provides a special check on the number of calls that can be made on a particular method.


Mockito provides the following additional methods to vary the expected call counts.

- atLeast (int min) − expects min calls.

- atLeastOnce () − expects at least one call.

- atMost (int max) − expects max calls.
