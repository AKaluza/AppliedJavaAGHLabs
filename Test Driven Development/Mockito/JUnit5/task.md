### Mockito and JUnit
We will create a Math Application which uses CalculatorService to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiply, and division.

We'll use Mockito to mock the dummy implementation of CalculatorService. 
In addition, we've made extensive use of annotations to showcase their compatibility with both JUnit and Mockito.
